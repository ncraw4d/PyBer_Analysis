# PyBer Analysis

## Purpose of the Analysis

The purpose of the PyBer Analysis was to show the the differences in number of drivers, total rides, and total fares between three city types. The city types were urban, suburban, and rural. This analysis helped the ride share company, PyBer, make financial and business decisions based on the data that was shared. 

### Dataframe Screenshot of Ride Share Results per City Type

The results show a significant difference between the three city types. The urban ride share drivers outnumbered the suburban drivers 5 to 1 and the rural drivers by 97%. The data also shows the average fare per driver in urban cities is 40% less than in suburban cities and 66% less than in rural cities. Even though rural drivers earn more per ride they have significantly less rides than urban drivers. Rural drivers had 93% less rides than urban drivers, and 80% less rides than suburban drivers. This shows rural areas use ride share less often than suburban and urban areas. Suburban areas were also 60% less likely to use ride share than urban areas.

##### Pyber Business Recommendations

The data shows there are more ride share drivers in the urban cities than total rides. There were 780 more drivers than customers using the service whereas in both rural and suburban cities there were more rides than total drivers. PyBer should implement marketing in the urban cities to draw in more customers to use the ride share service. PyBer should also reduce the number of drivers in urban cities so their drivers can earn more since the data shows 780 drivers did not earn anything. As total rides increase in the urban cities, Pyber can increase the amount of drivers there. Since ride share is used less often in the rural and suburban cities, PyBer all ready has less drivers than riders so PyBer does not need to make any changes in those two areas.
