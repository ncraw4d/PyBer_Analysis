# PyBer Analysis

## Purpose of the Analysis

The purpose of the PyBer Analysis was to show the the differences in number of drivers, total rides, and total fares between three city types. The city types were urban, suburban, and rural. This analysis helped the ride share company, PyBer, make financial and business decisions based on the data that was shared.

The results show a significant difference between the three city types. The urban ride share drivers outnumbered the suburban drivers 5 to 1 and the rural drivers by 97%. The data also shows the average fare per driver in urban cities is 40% less than in suburban cities and 66% less than in rural cities. Even though rural drivers earn more per ride they have significantly less rides than urban drivers. Rural drivers had 93% less rides than urban drivers, and 80% less rides than suburban drivers. This shows rural areas use ride share less often than suburban and urban areas. Suburban areas were also 60% less likely to use ride share than urban areas.
